# Food names distribution

A map to display language variety of food names in United States, United Kingdom, Mexico and Spain.


## How this works

We took a bunch of data from Wikipedia and processed to find food names and their varieties according to regions classified by counties in US, MX and UK and provinces in ES.

With this data, we plot the finding in a map.

There is still a lot of cleaning pending on the data, but hey, that's what is about data processing, right?
